# 2048 Game
This is a simple implementation of the 2048 game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game involves merging tiles with the same number to create larger numbered tiles, with the goal of reaching the 2048 tile.

## Game Rules
* Use the arrow keys to move the tiles.
* Tiles with the same number merge into one when they touch. For example, two 2 tiles will merge into a 4 tile.
* The game ends when there are no more valid moves (i.e., no empty spaces and no adjacent tiles with the same number).
